Prototype for the UI of Maket Technologies.

This is my attempt at making a prototype for an UI using React.js

This app is made up of different routes which will render different components (corresponding to different pages).
It consists of navigation bar made up by myself using good old HTML and CSS and the page rendered by the route.

At the beginning, there is a blue background starting page with a start button. Once clicked, this updates the app's state
and brings the user into another page where the navigation bar is displayed, but through the use of routing, the user 
can change the content that is rendered on the screen.

There is only dummy data inside as it is only an idea for a prototype.

On the Budget page, I tried to implement a slider for the user using Material UI, but I couldn't managed to do it.
I did the correct imports, but the slider doesn't appear for some reason.

The source is on the "master" branch and the "gh-pages" branch holds the built app code.

The project is deployed on Github Pages and is accessible here : https://emmanuel-mfum.github.io/maket-ui/
